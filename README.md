Spherical manipulators are fascinating machines that can move and manipulate objects within a spherical region. Its modern variants offer distinct advantages over their predecessors, expanding their capabilities and potential applications, such as Stewart platforms, which use six independently actuated linear actuators arranged in a hexapod configuration; cable-driven robots, which use cables instead of rigid links and offer a larger workspace, lighter weight, and inherent compliance; and parallel manipulators with spherical workspace, which combine features of different manipulator types to achieve a spherical workspace.
