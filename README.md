Spherical manipulators are intriguing machines capable of moving and manipulating objects within a spherical workspace. Modern versions like Stewart platforms, cable-driven robots, and parallel manipulators with spherical workspaces offer unique advantages over traditional models, enhancing their capabilities and potential uses. These manipulators find applications in various industries for tasks like assembly, welding, and painting in complex environments, as well as in medical settings for surgeries and rehabilitation. They also play a role in search and rescue missions, underwater research, and entertainment and educational experiences. Compared to traditional manipulators, modern spherical manipulators provide a larger workspace, increased precision, adaptability, and scalability, making them more efficient and cost-effective. As a result, they are likely to see continued growth and innovation in the future.

The SCARA PRR robot, a variation of the Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm with a unique joint design, is known for its speed, precision, and compact size ideal for pick-and-place and assembly tasks. The Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute configuration features a linear joint at the base and two rotational joints in the arm, offering advantages such as lifting heavy weights due to the powerful motors in the prismatic joint. The PRR variation also provides a wider workspace for vertical reach, complex route planning capabilities, and is commonly used in industries like electronics assembly and semiconductor manufacturing for tasks like component placement and material handling. This variant is especially suited for applications requiring complex path planning in the vertical direction, such as stacking or dispensing liquids.

Cartesian manipulator on a ceiling, known as a ceiling-mounted robot, is a robotic arm with three linear axes (X, Y, Z) that operates from above. It offers advantages like efficient movement and access to overhead space. It excels in tasks such as component assembly, material transport, feeding large objects, and painting or welding large structures. It can also install cameras for inspections and maintenance in hard-to-reach areas. These robots save floor space, reach inaccessible areas, and cover broad workspaces effectively, making them ideal for tasks like painting and checking large areas. Their stiff structure and regulated movements along linear axes provide precision and repeatability. Ideal for industries like automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, they excel in huge work areas, precision, and safety. Overall, ceiling-mounted manipulators are valuable for applications requiring overhead space and precise movement in three dimensions.
