Spherical manipulators are fascinating machines that can move and manipulate objects within a spherical region. Its modern variants offer distinct advantages over their predecessors, expanding their capabilities and potential applications, such as Stewart platforms, which use six independently actuated linear actuators arranged in a hexapod configuration; cable-driven robots, which use cables instead of rigid links and offer a larger workspace, lighter weight, and inherent compliance; and parallel manipulators with spherical workspace, which combine features of different manipulator types to achieve a spherical workspace.

Because of their unique characteristics, modern spherical manipulators have several applications:

a.	Industrial uses include delicate assembly activities in limited places, manipulating things within pipelines or tanks, and welding or painting tasks in complex geometries. 

b.	Medical applications include teleoperated surgery, rehabilitation robots, and minimally invasive procedures that necessitate high dexterity and precision in a small space. 

c.	Service applications include search and rescue missions, underwater research, and inspection and maintenance of difficult-to-reach infrastructure. 

d.	Entertainment and education include interactive robotic exhibitions, immersive virtual reality experiences, and advanced simulator motion platforms.

These manipulators have several advantages over traditional manipulators, including a larger and more dexterous workspace that allows for access and manipulation in confined or complex environments, high precision and control that allows for delicate tasks and accurate operations, a lightweight and adaptable design that allows for deployment in a variety of applications, and the potential for modularity and scalability that allows for customization for specific requirements. Modern versions overcome the constraints of older designs, making them more efficient, dependable, and cost-effective. This opens the door to even greater adoption and novel applications in the future.

The SCARA PRR variant, also known as the Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute SCARA robot, is a Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm (SCARA) with a unique joint design. SCARA robots are popular due to their high speed, precision, and compact size, making them excellent for activities such as pick-and-place and assembly in a variety of sectors. The Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute (PRR) variation explains the robot arm's joint type sequence. As a result, a SCARA PRR robot has a linear joint at its base and two rotational joints in its arm. This arrangement has certain distinct advantages and applications when compared to the more popular Revolute-Revolute-Prismatic (RRP) SCARA variation.

The PRR variation stands out because it can raise enormous weights. This is due to the PRR's fixed base, which allows for powerful motors in the prismatic joint, allowing it to carry heavier objects than the RRP type, which lifts both the arm and the object. It also features a wider workspace due to the prismatic joint, which gives extra vertical reach, hence expanding the robot's useful workspace when compared to the RRP version. In addition, it offers complex route planning, making it better suited for applications that require complex path planning in the vertical direction, such as stacking or dispensing liquids. Lastly, these robots are commonly utilized in industries such as electronics assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, and food processing, where they execute functions such as component placement, material handling, and dispensing.

A Cartesian manipulator on a ceiling, also known as a ceiling-mounted robot, is a robotic arm with three linear axes (X, Y, and Z) that operates from above. In comparison to floor-mounted robots, this design provides various advantages and unique applications. First, ceiling-mounted robots thrive in activities that require overhead space and efficient movement. They can be used to do jobs such as assembling components from above to improve access and visibility, transporting materials rapidly and precisely across huge workplaces, and properly feeding large or heavy objects into machines. Furthermore, ceiling-mounted robots can enable consistent and precise spraying of paint or other coatings on huge items or complicated surfaces, as well as improved access and maneuverability for welding or cutting large structures, particularly when combined with rotatory axes. It can also install cameras and sensors on its robot arm to inspect difficult-to-reach regions or execute delicate maintenance operations. Finally, it can be employed in a variety of applications, including stage automation, light shows, and artistic installations.

This type of manipulator is useful because ceiling-mounted robots save valuable floor space, which can be critical in busy manufacturing plants. They can also access locations that are difficult or dangerous for humans to reach, improving safety and efficiency. Also, their above-mentioned location allows them to effectively cover broad workspaces, making them ideal for jobs such as painting massive objects or checking large areas. Lastly, they provide great precision and repeatability due to their stiff structure and regulated movements along linear axes.
