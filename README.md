Spherical manipulators are intriguing machines capable of moving and manipulating objects within a spherical workspace. Modern versions like Stewart platforms, cable-driven robots, and parallel manipulators with spherical workspaces offer unique advantages over traditional models, enhancing their capabilities and potential uses. These manipulators find applications in various industries for tasks like assembly, welding, and painting in complex environments, as well as in medical settings for surgeries and rehabilitation. They also play a role in search and rescue missions, underwater research, and entertainment and educational experiences. Compared to traditional manipulators, modern spherical manipulators provide a larger workspace, increased precision, adaptability, and scalability, making them more efficient and cost-effective. As a result, they are likely to see continued growth and innovation in the future.

The SCARA PRR robot, a variation of the Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm with a unique joint design, is known for its speed, precision, and compact size ideal for pick-and-place and assembly tasks. The Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute configuration features a linear joint at the base and two rotational joints in the arm, offering advantages such as lifting heavy weights due to the powerful motors in the prismatic joint. The PRR variation also provides a wider workspace for vertical reach, complex route planning capabilities, and is commonly used in industries like electronics assembly and semiconductor manufacturing for tasks like component placement and material handling. This variant is especially suited for applications requiring complex path planning in the vertical direction, such as stacking or dispensing liquids.

A Cartesian manipulator on a ceiling, also known as a ceiling-mounted robot, is a robotic arm with three linear axes (X, Y, and Z) that operates from above. In comparison to floor-mounted robots, this design provides various advantages and unique applications. First, ceiling-mounted robots thrive in activities that require overhead space and efficient movement. They can be used to do jobs such as assembling components from above to improve access and visibility, transporting materials rapidly and precisely across huge workplaces, and properly feeding large or heavy objects into machines. Furthermore, ceiling-mounted robots can enable consistent and precise spraying of paint or other coatings on huge items or complicated surfaces, as well as improved access and maneuverability for welding or cutting large structures, particularly when combined with rotatory axes. It can also install cameras and sensors on its robot arm to inspect difficult-to-reach regions or execute delicate maintenance operations. Finally, it can be employed in a variety of applications, including stage automation, light shows, and artistic installations.

This type of manipulator is useful because ceiling-mounted robots save valuable floor space, which can be critical in busy manufacturing plants. They can also access locations that are difficult or dangerous for humans to reach, improving safety and efficiency. Also, their above-mentioned location allows them to effectively cover broad workspaces, making them ideal for jobs such as painting massive objects or checking large areas. Lastly, they provide great precision and repeatability due to their stiff structure and regulated movements along linear axes.

Overall, ceiling-mounted manipulators are an excellent choice for applications where overhead space is available and effective movement in all three dimensions is required. They are especially vital in industries like automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, where huge work areas, precision, and safety are critical.
