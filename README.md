Spherical manipulators are fascinating machines that can move and manipulate objects within a spherical region. Its modern variants offer distinct advantages over their predecessors, expanding their capabilities and potential applications, such as Stewart platforms, which use six independently actuated linear actuators arranged in a hexapod configuration; cable-driven robots, which use cables instead of rigid links and offer a larger workspace, lighter weight, and inherent compliance; and parallel manipulators with spherical workspace, which combine features of different manipulator types to achieve a spherical workspace.

Because of their unique characteristics, modern spherical manipulators have several applications.

a.	Industrial uses include delicate assembly activities in limited places, manipulating things within pipelines or tanks, and welding or painting tasks in complex geometries. 

b.	Medical applications include teleoperated surgery, rehabilitation robots, and minimally invasive procedures that necessitate high dexterity and precision in a small space. 

c.	Service applications include search and rescue missions, underwater research, and inspection and maintenance of difficult-to-reach infrastructure. 

d.	Entertainment and education include interactive robotic exhibitions, immersive virtual reality experiences, and advanced simulator motion platforms.

These manipulators have several advantages over traditional manipulators, including a larger and more dexterous workspace that allows for access and manipulation in confined or complex environments, high precision and control that allows for delicate tasks and accurate operations, a lightweight and adaptable design that allows for deployment in a variety of applications, and the potential for modularity and scalability that allows for customization for specific requirements. Modern versions overcome the constraints of older designs, making them more efficient, dependable, and cost-effective. This opens the door to even greater adoption and novel applications in the future.
